# WaltsonJS
Repository for work being conducted in CS 499 at the University of Alabama.
This project is a work in progress, but the goal is to build a Watson chatbot to diagnose orthopedic patients based on what symptoms they exhibit.

All code written in the base directory is by Walt Loumakis, in addition to the bintree module in the node_modules directory.
