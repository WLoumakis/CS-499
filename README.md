# WaltsonJS
Repository for work being conducted in CS 499 at the University of Alabama.
This project is a work in progress, but the goal is to create a language that can easily represent an IBM Watson Assistant chatbot and fluidly translate that representation into a single NodeJS script that can be run to build the entire chatbot.

All code (other than within the node_modules directory) is written by Walt Loumakis.

This project was conducted under the supervision of Dr. John C. Lusth at the University of Alabama.
